# History
Workout Web is an attempt to create the workout tracking / program generating app I always wanted. I realized while doing this project that Full Stack Python was NOT the path forward, and that I needed to learn a full JavaScript stack in order to build the app I actually want. Additionally the ideal was always a mobile app.

Workout Web is, and will remain a fully functional Full Stack Web App with a solid backend, and a frontend severely limited by the tools I had available at the time. It's a legacy project that demonstrates how far I was able to get with pure Python and backend development for a Full Stack App.

# Future
I still love this project, and the idea behind it. Now that I've picked up Full Stack JavaScript I have significantly better tools to upgrade and work on this further. Specifically a full rewrite in React Native, with a serverless backend in order to get maximum flexibility between platforms. It will be mobile first design, as that's where I always wanted to take the original, but will have a fully functional webapp as well!
